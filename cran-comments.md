## Resubmission
This is a resubmission of 'ComBatFamQC' (version 1.0.2) in response to CRAN comments.

### Issues Addressed:
1. Updated the package description to enclose the package name in single quotes: 'ComBatFamQC'.
2. Added references in the description field to describe the methods, formatted per CRAN guidelines (e.g., authors (year) <doi:...>).
3. Replaced all instances of `print()` with `message()` in `R/visual_prep.R` and `R/Help_Func.R` to align with CRAN's recommended practices for console output.
4. Ensured the use of `tempfile()` for creating temporary directories in examples, vignettes, and tests to comply with CRAN's file handling policies.
5. Cleaned up all temporary files using `unlink()`.
6. Optimized examples to ensure they run in less than 5 seconds.

### Notes Addressed:

The flagged words (e.g., "Pomponio," "centiles," "et al.") are part of valid citations and technical terms used in the description.
